Title: Random Forests for Change Point Detection
Version: 0.7.2
Author: Malte Londschien
Maintainer: Malte Londschien <malte@londschien.ch>
Description: Change point detection tries to identify times when the probability distribution of a
    stochastic process or time series changes. Existing methods either assume a parametric
    model for within-segment distributions or are based on ranks or distances and thus fail
    in scenarios with a reasonably large dimensionality.

    `changeforest` implements a classifier-based algorithm that consistently estimates
    change points without any parametric assumptions, even in high-dimensional scenarios.
    See [1] for details.
