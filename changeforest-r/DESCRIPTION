Title: Random Forests for Change Point Detection
Version: 1.1.2
Author: Malte Londschien
Maintainer: Malte Londschien <malte@londschien.ch>
Description:
    Change point detection tries to identify times when the probability distribution of a
    stochastic process or time series changes. Existing methods either assume a parametric
    model for within-segment distributions or are based on ranks or distances and thus fail
    in scenarios with a reasonably large dimensionality.
    changeforest implements a classifier-based algorithm that consistently estimates
    change points without any parametric assumptions, even in high-dimensional scenarios.
    See M. Londschien, P. Bühlmann and S. Kovács (2023). "Random Forests for Change Point Detection" Journal of Machine Learning Research
    for details.
